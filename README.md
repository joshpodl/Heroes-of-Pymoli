# Heroes of Pymoli Video Game Data Analysis with Pandas


#### Three observable conclusions based on the data:

Males make up a significant percentage of unique players, 84.03%, and account for a significant portion of the total purchase value ($1,967.64 of $2379.77, or 82.68%). However, they rank lower than both females and other / non-disclosed gender players in average purchase price and average purchase total per person.

The age group 20-24 makes up a significant percentage of players (44.79%) and accounts for a significant count of the purchases (365 out of 780, or 46.79%). The gaming company would be wise to find ways to advertise and appeal to this age demographic.

Final Critic, Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm, and Fiery Glass Crusader rank among the top five in both most popular and most profitable items. The presence of these three items in the top five of both most popular and most profitable indicates that there is some correlation between popularity and profitability.
